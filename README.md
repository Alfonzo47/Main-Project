# Main-Project


# Project Ironman

This project focoses on developing a small prototype of an isokinetic dynamometer specifically designed for a single finger joint to facilitate the collection of relevant data and 
validate the practical functionality of the design. The idea of our device is to measure muscle strength under a constant angular velocity or extension. The core goal of this
prototype is to strip down the functionality of the original, full-scale clinical machine to just a few essential components. This makes the device significantly cheaper and easier
to implement in various smaller clinics or hospitals. Our intended user is primarily physiotherapists and researchers who require the data for the rehabilitation of 
patients with joint related injuries. Our project aims to widen the access to this type of machine.
